# Battle Royale Game (HTML5/JS)

This is a basic browser-based Battle Royale game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player battles AI enemies, collects ammo, and survives as the safe zone shrinks.

## How to Play

- **Movement**: Use `WASD` or `Arrow Keys` to move.
- **Shoot**: Click anywhere in the game area to shoot in that direction.
- **Ammo**: Pick up weapons for more ammo.
- **Safe Zone**: Stay inside the invisible shrinking safe zone to avoid health loss.
- **Win**: Eliminate all enemies.

## Features

- Animated player, enemies, and bullets
- Pick up weapons for more ammo
- Shrinking safe zone
- HUD with health, ammo, kills, timer
- Start and Game Over screens

## Customization

- Change initial enemies/weapons by modifying `spawnEnemies()` and `spawnWeapons()` calls in the script.
- Adjust safe zone shrink speed in the `gameState.safeZone.shrinkSpeed` property.
- Update visuals by editing CSS and placeholder images.

## To Run

1. Copy the HTML above into a file, e.g., `index.html`.
2. Open it in your browser.
3. Click **START GAME** and enjoy!

## Notes

- This is a simple prototype with basic AI and mechanics.
- For a production game, add safe zone visualization, sound, and polish enemy AI.
